# Customer Rating System

## Problem Statement: 

Every bank runs on trust of its customer and it is equally important for a bank to maintain reputation in the market.
One scam or money laundering activity could make any bank reputation to go on toss, to avoid such situation as a
bank it is so much important to know the nature of the customer i.e what kind of business customer is doing , what
are the most incoming and outgoing transaction origin for a customer etc.

Our business problem is to identify each customer real time transaction and based on that do risk rating of the
customer, as an operational person I should be able to see HIGH RISK rating customer , MEDIUM RISK rating
customer and LOW RISK rating customer.

So that review/monitoring should be initiated for the HIGH RISK & MEDIUM RISK customers.

## Our approach:

Considering less time we used python for our backend, and used streamlit framework for UI, b y adding HTML files of login, Customer_Search and Main.

We Analysed the dataset using Pandas Library of Python in Google Colab, and tried to create the logics for High, medium and low independently in order to cluster the customers.

There were 4 categories in High - H1, H2, H3 & H4
Our code is working fine for H1 and H2 category but facing some errors in remaining.
